# Hybrid-Energy-Storage-System
This report details the research conducted on a Battery/Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System (ESS) for UWAFTâ€™s upcoming vehicle, the EcoCar 4.

In order to counteract the low power denisty, limited cycle life and limited capability of receiving recovered energy during regenerative
braking of Lithium-Ion batteries, a type of supercapacitor known as the Electrolytic Double-
Layer Capacitor is introduced and its method of operation through seperation of ions and physical
adsorption on the terminal surface is discussed.

It is further shown how these supercapacitors provide
very high power density, virtually unlimited cycle life and robustness to high temperature and
fluctuating current loads. The ability of these devices to receive greater amounts of energy during
regenerative braking is also discussed.
